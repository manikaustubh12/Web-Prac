    <p> The men in blue had a blow hot blow cold kind of 2022. They dominated in mostly all the bilateral series played this year but failed to get their hands on an ICC trophy. India also failed to perform decently in the Asia Cup. The men in blue have somehow ended this year on a high after winning a Test series against Bangladesh by a margin of 2-0. The focus now entirely shifts to the One Day International World Cup that will be played in India in 2023.India will start their preparations against Sri Lanka and the first match will be played on January 3, 2022, in Mumbai. India will look to turn their fortunes around and emerge victorious in ICC events. Here is looking at India's entire schedule for 2023.</p>
